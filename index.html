          <p>My hobby is Drawing and painting.I think drawing is the best hobby. You can create art anywhere as long as you have two things: pencils and paper. <br><br>It's good to start at a young age because it gives you a chance to start using your brain and to be creative. Also, it is an opportunity to challenge thinking skills and develop learning skills.I love to draw with different colours. Drawing gives me happiness.Even Sketching and drawing is a great way to improve your creative skills and start thinking in a different way.<br><br> Art shows you that there is normally more than one way to solve a problem. Art encourages open ended thinking and creativity.<br><br> These can be really helpful for personal development and solving problems. Skills you learn through sketching can be applied in a number of different areas in your life.
          Sketching helps develop a number of different areas of your brain. You develop your ability to focus and pay attention, a skill that can be very useful throughout your life and career.<br><br> It also develops hand-eye coordination so that everyday tasks can become easier for you. But it also develops strategic thinking, something which everyone needs to be able to do some amount of.</p>

            <p>My parents are the role model of my life. My family is very inspiring to me. I am very thankful that my parents brought me into this world. Growing up my parents always showed me how exactly things work in life. One of the hardest things that I had to accept was that I could not have everything I wanted. There were times when my parents spoiled me but I was always taught to be thankful of the things that I had and to not be so selfish. Having two other siblings helped me prevent the want of being selfish.<br><br> I do not know what I would do without my family. My family is very inspiring because they show me all aspects on how I should live my life through their experiences like education, parenting, and work ethic.My familyâ€™s past experiences also teach me how to live my life the best way possible. For example, my parents did not finish college, so they were not able to obtain lucrative careers. Not finishing or not even going to college can take a toll on your life. If my parents finished college our life would have been more successful financially.</p>
